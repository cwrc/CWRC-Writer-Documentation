      <div class="p">To get started in CWRC-Writer, we suggest familiarizing yourself with CWRC-Writer in a
        sample document first, and then moving on to trying to create a new document if you
          wish.<br/><div class="imagecenter"><img class="image imagecenter" id="reference_isj_bhh_rp__image_tjv_zhh_rp" src="http://beta.cwrc.ca/islandora/object/cwrc%3Afcc5c34a-aefe-4829-af9e-68d3ba4d1d49/datastream/OBJ/view" height="384" width="576"/></div><br/><p class="lines">Please handle with care:</p>
<p class="lines">Please do not use your browser's "Undo" button. We are working towards making this option usable within CWRC-Writer, however currently it does not work and using it may cause unpredictable results.</p>
<p class="lines">Allow CWRC-Writer a few seconds to load each page. If you interrupt the loading process you may have to shut down and reopen CWRC_Writer to continue working with this tool. You can open a saved document or a new template using the "Load" button on the toolbar. The CWRC logo in the upper left corner will take you outside the CWRC-Writer to the CWRC website (www.cwrc.ca). the new entity data option VIAF and GeoNames also take a few seconds to load. Thank you for your patience.</p>
<p class="lines">If you are having problems with CWRC-Writer, please call your browser cache. If the problem persists, please email cwrc@ualberta.ca</p>
